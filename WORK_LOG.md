| 2/24 |  2:30-3:00pm   |                                                                                                                                    I brainstormed in class to look for the optimal substructure. |
| 2/24 | 9:50 - 10:25pm |                                                                                                                         I continued brainstorming and thinking through the optimal substructure. |
| 2/26 | 12:45 - 1:15pm |                                                                                            I worked with Mr. Blick to think through the problem by drawing a table and figuring out the pattern. |
| 2/26 | 1:15 - 1:45pm  | I continued working with Mr. Blick and then began coding the algorithm we came up with that uses a tabulation approach of checking the values to the top and left. Got two of the cases working. |
| 2/26 | 3:40 - 4:00pm  |                                                                                                              I worked on debugging the code to see why my values were greater than the expected. |
